A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

## Work in progress
 This is still work in progress if given more time, I could spend some more time on the UI and refine it further.
 There is still some work needs to be done for the header as I was having trouble with it's background color.
 But since I had 2 days to finish this and backend, I had to submit it as it is.
