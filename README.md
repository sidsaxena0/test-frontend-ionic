# Test Frontend Ionic

This is an Angular project created for an assignment.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Node.js
- npm
- Angular CLI

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repo
   [git clone https://github.com/sidsaxena0/test-frontend-ionic.git](https://github.com/sidsaxena0/test-frontend-ionic.git)
2. Navigate into the cloned repository
   cd test-frontend-ionic
3. Install NPM packages
   npm install
5. Start the server
   ionic serve

## Future Improvements
 This could be improved as toolbar shadow needs to be dealt with or needs to apply a custom header correctly.
 I have tried to manage the UI as per the given design within the timeline but still, there are some improvements that can be done.
